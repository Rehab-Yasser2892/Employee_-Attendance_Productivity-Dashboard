# Employee Attendance & Productivity Dashboard

Data analysis is not just about charts and dashboards. It’s about understanding what the data is telling us and turning it into actionable decisions that can truly support management.

## 🔍 Problem

The goal of this dashboard is to:

- Monitor attendance and absenteeism rates
- Analyze overtime hours
- Evaluate productivity across departments
- Identify departments facing high pressure or underperformance

## ⚙️ Process

1. Explored the data to fully understand business requirements and key metrics.
2. Analyzed the relationships between attendance, overtime, productivity, and workload across departments.
3. Extracted insights and translated them into actionable recommendations for management.

## 🎯 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Overall Attendance Rate:** 80%
- **Overall Absenteeism Rate:** 20%
- **Average Working Hours:** 6.5 hours
- **Total Overtime Hours:** 27 hours
- **Average Productivity Score:** 66.7

## 📈 Insights

- Operations and HR have the highest attendance rates.
- HR is the most productive department without relying heavily on overtime, making it a strong efficiency benchmark.
- Finance is the most pressured department due to workload and overtime dependency.
- IT shows the highest level of underperformance, indicating potential gaps in workload distribution or engagement.
- While overtime generally contributes to higher productivity, efficiency matters more than working longer hours. Despite Finance working the most overtime, HR achieves the highest productivity.

## 🌟 Decisions & Recommendations

- Monitor and optimize overtime hours in Finance to reduce pressure and prevent burnout.
- Use HR as a reference model for improving productivity without increasing overtime.
- Rebalance workload across departments to maintain productivity while improving employee well-being.

## 🛠 Tools

- Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Advanced Formulas)
